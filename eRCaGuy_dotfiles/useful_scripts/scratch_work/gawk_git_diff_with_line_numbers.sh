# Be sure to include screenshots and demo input files.
# file.cpp original and file.cpp new, to give people something to run `git diffn` on!
# Save this script into a file called `git-diffn`. It will be run as `git diffn`.
# Note: it will keep numbers aligned up to 4 chars, or a maximum line number of 9999.

# 3. Once done with this, also integrate using `git diffn` into my `git-filechange-search` script,
# which you should also integrate into a git usage; ex: `git filechange` alias.
# Also, edit that script to auto-detect if the user has `git diffn` available, and if they don't, 
# pop up a warning and instructions on how to get and install it.
