# find_and_replace.sh
# - find and replace a string across multiple files, using regular expressions
#   - excellent for mass variable replacements/variable renaming when writing software, for instance

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Create a symlink in ~/bin to this script so you can run it from anywhere:
#       cd /path/to/here
#       mkdir -p ~/bin
#       ln -si "${PWD}/find_and_replace.sh" ~/bin/gs_find_and_replace
# 2. Now you can use the `gs_find_and_replace` command directly anywhere you like.

# References:
# 1. I used my "PDF2SearchablePDF" bash-based project as a model for how to write good bash scripts
#    and code when wiriting this program. Here is the file of mine I was referencing:

# TODO list: 
# 1. Make the option parsing much more robust, and add a `--dry-run` / `-d` option to just show
# what *would be* replaced without actually replacing anything!
# 2. Make this a stand-alone repository, perhaps, as I think it would get more usage and 
# exposure that way.
# 3. ADD THIS TO THE MAIN DOTFILES INSTALLATION SCRIPT AS PART OF THE MAIN INSTALLATION PROCESS!
# 4.
