# This is a very basic example of what you might want to add to a local git repo's ".git/config" file.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Update name and email below, edit other fields as desired, then append to any repo's .git/config file:
# Option 1) just manually copy and paste the text below into your repo's .git/config file.
# Option 2) do it from the command-line: `cat .gitconfig_local >> /path/to/my/repo/.git/config`
