== ROS Wiki Editing Intro. & Formatting ==

The ROS Wiki uses the MoinMoin Wiki Engine (http://moinmo.in/). If you are familiar with the markdown language used on places like Stack Overflow or Github, or the Wikipedia wiki language, that will all be helpful. 

A full description of the Moin Moin Wiki syntax is here: http://moinmo.in/HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax.

To escape special characters, use their number codes: https://moinmo.in/SpecialCharacters.

Special macros also exist, such as `<<TOC(4)>>` to indicate "place a Table of Contents here showing up to 4 levels deep."

== How to Edit a ROS Wiki Page ==

To get started editing the ROS Wiki, first Log in and create an account using the "Login" button at the right. Once you've done that, you must [[https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/roswiki/issues/258|Request to be added to ROS wiki whitelist here]]. Once you've been approved, simply click the "Edit" link at the right, a bit above where the "Login" link was, to edit a page. Be sure to be professional and maintain good formatting. 

'''2 spaces''' are recommended before every bullet or number, and to indent each new level. Example:

Use

{{{
  1. line one
    1. sub-line one
    2. sub-line two
  1. line two
  1. line three 
}}}

not

{{{
 1. line one
  1. sub-line one
  2. sub-line two
 1. line two
 1. line three 
}}}

to produce:

  1. line one
    1. sub-line one
    2. sub-line two
  1. line two
  1. line three 

For headings, be sure to have ''no spaces after the ending `=` symbol'' or else they will not work!

{{{
= heading =

no space is allowed after the trailing `=` above!
}}}

To add Note or IMPORTANT note boxes, you can do this:

{{{{
{{{#!wiki blue/solid
'''Note:''' Some note.
}}}
}}}}

to get this:

{{{#!wiki blue/solid
'''Note:''' Some note.
}}}

or this:

{{{{
{{{#!wiki blue/solid
'''IMPORTANT:''' Some important note.
}}}
}}}}

to get this:

{{{#!wiki blue/solid
'''IMPORTANT:''' Some important note.
}}}

or this:

{{{{
{{{#!wiki caution
'''Some cautionary title'''

Some cautionary note
}}}
}}}}

to get this:

{{{#!wiki caution
'''Some cautionary title'''

Some cautionary note
}}}
