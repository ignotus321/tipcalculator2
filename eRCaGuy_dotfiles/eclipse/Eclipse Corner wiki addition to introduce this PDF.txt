I just added (submitted for review) the following section to the Eclipse Corner page here: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Corner.  
Hopefully it gets accepted.  

Summary: significantly update this section description, & move it to the top since it details basic Eclipse setup, concepts, & usage and also acts as a good intro to Eclipse: == Eclipse setup instructions on a new Linux (or other OS) computer ==

Getting started with Eclipse as a beginner is difficult. This document ''significantly'' eases that transition. Even for experienced Eclipse users, getting it to work perfectly and bug-free on large projects requires several advanced tricks, all of which are documented carefully in this document with the words "[IMPORTANT TO PREVENT FREEZES]". This is unofficial documentation to help Eclipse users get Eclipse installed and configured on any operating system, with a particular emphasis on using Eclipse on Linux. It details getting it to work well and crash-free on any OS when working with small or gigantic projects. 

This document also introduces in detail the following concepts which are unique to Eclipse and very confusing for beginners: 
# workspace
# project
# perspective
# working set
...and it introduces dozens of really useful shortcuts used daily by experienced Eclipse developers. 

Here is a snapshot of its table of contents:
# Table of Contents:  1
