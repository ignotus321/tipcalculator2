# Edit as desired, then copy to ~/.profile
# - Option 1) doesn't exist yet, so copy whole thing over: `cp -i .profile ~`
# - Option 2) append contents to existing .profile file: `cat .profile >> ~/.profile`
# - Note that one important purpose of the ~/.profile file is to add a user's private ~/bin dir to the PATH variable;
