## Some of my personal googletest/googlemock documentation

1. **[insights.md](insights.md)** - a detailed look at some aspects of the proper usage of googlemocks/googletest.
    1. See also [my answer on Stack Overflow here: "google mock - can I call EXPECT_CALL multiple times on same mock object?"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60905880/4561887). If this is helpful to you, please upvote it to signal to others it is worth looking at. A lot of work went into learning and writing it, and I'd appreciate that. ðŸ™‚
